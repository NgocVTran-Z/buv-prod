      "The Personal and Social Growth (PSG) Programme is a unique initiative of British University Vietnam (BUV) to encourage students’ well-rounded development and enable them to acquire essential skills, qualities, and qualifications for future success. It is one of three key drivers of BUV, along with the accredited British and international higher education degrees in Vietnam, as well as a 5-star university campus with state-of-the-art learning spaces and dedicated support services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going parallel with and complementing the academic degree programmes, the PSG Programme with a vast pool of activities outside the classroom can cater to students’ unique aspirations and facilitate their personal, social, professional, and academic growth in four aspects: Work & Career Readiness; University & Community Engagement; Social, Cultural and Emotional Development; and Academic Excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "To document students’ PSG journey, BUV awards PSG points in proportion to the efforts and achievements that the students make in different impactful activities. Upon successful completion of the PSG Programme, students will be awarded a PSG certificate and a detailed transcript of activities and points accumulated throughout their time at BUV. The PSG certificate is a competitive advantage for students to confidently seize opportunities in the real world.\n",

      "\n",
      "The PSG transcript presents each student’s achievements in their own PSG path: the activities, the contents and objectives of each activity, the duration of participation, and the number of points awarded. The transcript is neatly organised by category of activities and by academic semester, showing each individual’s progress in self-improvement and the diversity of their pursuits. It is thus very important that students select and arrange their activities participation over the years in a meaningful way so that the PSG transcript can best reflect their initiatives and career interests.\n",

      "| Below 500 | Not qualified for Certificate of Completion and PSG Transcript issuance |\n",
      "\n",
      "Both the Certificate of Completion and the PSG transcript will be signed and stamped by BUV as official recognition of students’ efforts in personal, social, professional, and academic development.

      "\n",
      "GENERAL QUESTIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "As a student studying at BUV, how do I know if the PSG Programme is compulsory for me or not?\n",
      "\n",
      "The PSG Programme is compulsory for all undergraduate students at BUV who pursue Bachelor’s degree programmes offered by any awarding body, typically lasting three to four years depending on the enrolled programme. This excludes students in Pre-University programmes (i.e. PWSU/Pathway to Staffordshire University & IFP/International Foundation Programme) and Postgraduates).\n",
      "\n",
      "Students participating in the Personal Development Programme (PDP) from the 2110 cohort to the 2301 cohort will be transferred to the new PSG Programme offerings and point scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will happen to my PDP activity records and transcripts when I am transferred to the new PSG Programme?\n",
      "\n",
      "When you transfer from the PDP Programme to the new PSG Programme, the current PDP activity records and points that you accumulated will be automatically transferred to your PSG records and transcripts.\n",
      "\n",
      "All PDP/PSG activities COMPLETED FROM OCTOBER 2023 (when PSG Programme is officially launched) will follow the new PSG point scheme. There may be differences in the number of points awarded for some similar activities in the PSG Programme compared to the PDP Programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: If you participate in an extra-curricular class from July 2023 to December 2023 (After the PSG programme is officially launched), you will NOT automatically receive 150 points based on the PDP point scheme anymore. You will be awarded points in accordance with the new PSG point scheme depending on the duration of the class:\n",
      "\n",
      "| Duration | Points |\n",
      "| - | - |\n",
      "| < 25 hours | 100 points/course |\n",
      "| 25 hours - 40 hours | 120 points/course |\n",
      "| > 40 hours | 150 points/course |\n",
      "\n",
      "If you meet all compulsory requirements to complete the PSG programme, you will be awarded a PSG certificate and a detailed PSG transcript with all activities and points accumulated throughout your time at BUV. All activities will be categorised into the new 4 quadrants and 16 categories of the PSG Programme instead of the 4 previous components of the PDP Programme (Skill Development, Work Experience, Extra-curricular Activities, Extra-curricular Classes):\n",
      "\n",
      "Quadrant 1: Work and Career Readiness\n",
      "\n",
      "Quadrant 2: University and Community Engagement\n",
      "\n",
      "Quadrant 3: Social, Cultural and Emotional Development\n",
      "\n",
      "Quadrant 4: Academic Excellence\n",
      "\n",
      "When I transfer to the new PSG Programme, do I need to meet the completion requirements of the PSG Programme?\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to complete the PSG Programme and graduate, you will need to meet the following compulsory requirements in replacement of the former PDP Programme's requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "Achieve at least 500 PSG points upon graduation\n",
      "\n",
      "Gain points in every main quadrant of the PSG programme: Work and Career Readiness; University and Community Engagement; Social, Cultural and Emotional Development; Academic Excellence . You can find more information about all PSG activities granting points under these 4 quadrants in APPENDIX 2. PSG activity list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complete at least one of the professional experience options or alternatives (Such as Part-time jobs, Internships, Work placements, Community projects with NGOs/NPOs/Social enterprises, Start-up incubation and acceleration, Running a business, Creating a personal professional portfolio, International study mobility programme). You can find more information about this requirement in APPENDIX 1. Instructions on professional experience options and alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students who meet and exceed the completion requirements of the PSG Programme will be awarded corresponding rankings and incentives upon each level of achievement:\n",
      "\n",
      "Bronze level: 500 points (by the end of 1st year)\n",
      "\n",
      "Silver level: 700 points (by the end of 1st or 2nd year)\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold level: 900 points (at any time)\n",
      "\n",
      "Platinum level: 1200 points (at any time)\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: If you accumulated 900 PDP points, they will be converted to 900 PSG points when you transfer to the PSG Programme. This means that you have reached the Gold level and are eligible for rewards specifically for this level. If you earn more points and reach or exceed 1200 points, you will also receive the incentives of the Platinum level.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## What happens if I don’t get PSG points for at least one out of 4 quadrants (e.g. no points for Social, Cultural and Emotional Development) even if I meet the other 2 criteria?\n",
      "\n",
      "You will not be eligible for a PSG certificate and transcript if you fail to participate in activities under all four quadrants: Work and Career Readiness; University and Community Engagement; Social, Cultural and Emotional Development; Academic Excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The goal of participation in all four quadrants of activities is to diversify students’ experiences and help students become more well-rounded in a wide range of personal, career, social, and academic aspects. For the most beneficial and meaningful PSG experience, students are expected to demonstrate active participation through both quantity (earning the minimum required points) and quality (engaging in a diverse range of activities). You can choose to focus on one quadrant or more depending on your interests and schedules, but it is important that you earn points in all four quadrants. Please note that you are subject to getting points in four quadrants only, not all 16 categories under the quadrants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Is it possible for students to gain PSG points by engaging in activities outside of BUV?\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes. The idea of the PSG Programme is to promote students’ well-rounded growth through diverse experiences outside the classroom. BUV, through the Student Engagement department, can draw on its rich resources and readily offer a lot of unique opportunities for students. However, students can proactively search for other opportunities that can be beneficial for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, for any activities outside of BUV (e.g. competitions, community projects, online courses on Coursera, running a business, etc.), in order to get recognition by BUV in the form of PSG points, students must provide clear evidence of participation and/or achievement. The evidence must be in official writing (e.g. documents, certificates, portfolios, etc.) and may need to be signed/stamped/validated by relevant organisations, and should include a detailed description/reflection of how the activity has been done and contributed to the student’s personal development. Without evidence, BUV cannot verify the authenticity and evaluate the effectiveness of any activity outside of BUV – how it is beneficial to the student and to BUV as an institution that endorses the student.\n",
      "\n",
      "When you have a meaningful experience outside of BUV that you wish to register into your PSG records, kindly follow the instructions below:\n",
      "\n",
      "Email the PSG Administrator (psg@buv.edu.vn) with a brief description of the experience (e.g. what kind of achievement and what official documentation you have got). The PSG Admin will decide if the experience can be recognised with PSG points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Receive an External Activity Report Form from PSG admin. Fill in the form with all the necessary information and detailed reflections on how the experience has benefited your personal and social growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Send the completed form along with all the evidence (pictures, documents, etc.) back to the PSG Administrator in the same email chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*The PSG Team is also developing an online function that allows students to register external activities into their PSG records on the Student Portal, we will let you know soon when the function is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kindly keep in mind that in reporting your external activities, you are essentially “applying” for BUV recognition with PSG points. As a result, please make a strong case for your achievement(s) with evidence and a meaningful reflection of the experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## I understand that it is required to earn at least 500 points for PSG after three years at BUV. However, is there a requirement for the specific number of points that I have to earn each year?\n",
      "\n",
      "The requirement is that you achieve at least 500 points during your whole time at BUV. This means that it does not matter how many points you get each year as long as you get 500 points or more in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, it is highly recommended that students pay attention to and make sensible plans for PSG participation each year. As an example, if your goal is to earn 500 points by graduation, you should earn 200 in your first year, 200 in your second year, and in 100 the last year(s). This not only motivates students to develop their organization and planning skills and exercise their proactiveness to participate in a comprehensive social and personal growth programme at BUV, but also instills in them a sense of independence, exploration and desire for progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can contact the PSG Team (psg@buv.edu.vn) and Career Services Team (se-careers@buv.edu.vn) for further guidance on planning your PSG journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have attended a few workshops on various topics, but I do not see they are listed in my PSG transcript. What is the reason for this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Workshop attendance is counted when you follow the attendance rules. Specifically, you need to check in within 15 minutes before/after the workshop starts and check out within 15 minutes before/after the workshop ends. There is no need for the students to self-report their attendance because the following processes are applied:\n",
      "\n",
      "If the activity is on BUV campus, the check-in/checkout must be done via the Facial Recognition system so that the attendance can be automatically recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the workshop is on Canvas (online), the check-in/checkout is automatically recorded on Canvas as the students log in with their BUV accounts and stay attentive during the time frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the workshop is off campus (i.e. outside BUV), the attendance will be recorded and verified by BUV staff or the activity’s organisers. You may have to send us your evidence for external activities' participation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, there are activities where points are only recognised if students complete the assigned tasks or follow-up work. The specific attendance requirements for different activities will be included in the announcements of the respective activities. Please keep in mind these processes to make sure your attendance is well-recorded for PSG points.\n",
      "\n",
      "PSG QUADRANTS AND CATEGORIES\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## WORK AND CAREER READINESS\n",
      "\n",
      "I have completed a professional experience option. How can I get the PSG points for it?\n",
      "\n",
      "If the professional experience option that you completed is one of these options: Part-time jobs; Internships; Work placements (Academic credited); Community projects with verified NGOs, NPOs, social enterprises; Start-up incubation and acceleration, you can follow the procedure below:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a specific timeline for form submission and certificate collection every semester. You can contact BUV Career Services & Industry Relations Team via se-careers@buv.edu.vn or meet the team directly at the Student Engagement Lounge on the first floor of BUV Campus for more detailed instructions on how to access and complete the Professional Experience Evaluation Form.\n",
      "\n",
      "After your Professional Experience Evaluation Form is validated, you will be awarded PSG points and an official Professional Experience Completion Certificate signed by the Head of Student Engagement Department. They are the recognition of your efforts and achievements in developing Work & Career Readiness. Apart from the PSG points, we also grant Internship Completion Certificate for those who request. If you would like to request one, please don’t forget to tick the box in the e-Evaluation Form on the Student Portal.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*If you choose the option to run a business, you need to follow the External Activity Report procedure outlined in Question 5 and provide the PSG Administrator with your Business Registration Certificate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\\*If you choose the option to create a personal professional portfolio, you also have to get an evaluation from your supervisors or an industry expert (depending on the topic of the portfolio).\n",
      "\n",
      "You can find more information about the procedure to get points for these options in APPENDIX 1. Instructions on professional experience options and alternatives and APPENDIX 3. PSG point scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "What are the differences between community projects with verified NGOs, NPOs, social enterprises AND short-term volunteering to help in the community?\n",
      "\n",
      "Participating in community projects with verified NGOs, NPOs, social enterprises is considered one of the professional experience options or alternatives that students need to choose to fulfill the PSG Programme’s completion requirements. To choose this option, students need to join a project with validated NGOs, NPOs, and social enterprises for at least 160 hours to get community-based work experience and make meaningful contributions to the community. Students also need to submit a professional experience evaluation form signed and stamped by the employer/supervisor to the Career Services team to be awarded PSG points. Those participating in this activity can receive from 100 to 200 PSG points depending on their participation duration throughout the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Short-term volunteering to help in the community is NOT considered one of the professional experience options or alternatives. Students will get points for this activity by acting as a volunteer who works for one-off or short-term voluntary activities and projects (For around 2 days and more), serving in the best interests of the community without receiving a financial reward. To be recorded points for this activity, students only need to follow the External Activity Report procedure outlined in Question 5 by sending evidence and reflecting on how the activity has benefited their personal and social growth instead of getting an evaluation form signed and stamped by the employer/supervisor. Depending on the participation duration of the activity, students can receive from 30 to 100 PSG points.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "How are different levels of participation and contribution in BUV student clubs and societies evaluated for PSG points?\n",
      "\n",
      "Every student who has the same position at BUV student clubs and societies will receive a set amount of PSG points (base points) if they meet the position requirements detailed in the PSG Activity List. For example, every President and Vice President of clubs and societies will receive 120 points/one-year term if they effectively lead their organisations, manage members, and deliver outcomes that contribute to the university.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, to ensure that students are fairly recognised for their comparative contributions and achievements and to encourage clubs and societies organise meaningful activities for other students, we will award bonus PSG points according to your level of participation in clubs and societies’ events/projects that open to BUV community or/and the external community.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example: When a club or society organises a medium-sized event (with at least 50 participants) open to BUV students, the event leader will receive 40 bonus points. If that event leader is the President of the club or society, at the end of their one-year term, he or she can receive 120 base points and 40 bonus points. The more meaningful activities that clubs and societies organise, the more bonus points their organising team members and leaders can earn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further details of the PSG point scheme for participation in student clubs and societies can be found in APPENDIX 2. PSG activity list and APPENDIX 3. PSG point scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "If I am not a student-led project leader, how can I earn points in the University and Community Engagement quadrant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Keep in mind that student-led projects do not need to be fancy, complicated or too far-reaching. Simply initiating an idea or attempting to run a campaign to raise awareness on social issues, e.g., cyber-bullying or recycling, can already be a meaningful project for the students. BUV fully supports students to try new things and experience growth in the most active way possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Members’ contributions will be recognised by the Core Organising Team (Project Leader, or Heads of Functions) during an evaluation process after each project and event. This evaluation process ensures that the members/coordinators/officers contribute and learn efficiently during the event/project. After the evaluation, members/coordinators/officers can receive from 20 to 80 points depending on the level of contribution assessed by their leaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "What types of activities can I participate in under the Social, Cultural, and Emotional Development quadrant?\n",
      "\n",
      "Any activities and workshops that help students to develop Self-awareness and Self-management competencies, Social and cultural awareness, and Relationship management skills organise by BUV or verified external organisations can fall under the Social, Cultural, and Emotional Development quadrant.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, you can participate in well-being workshops organised by BUV Student Well-being Team on topics such as non-violent communication, anti-bullying, mental health disorders, emotional safety skills, and many more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, there are projects, courses and activity weeks within the PSG programme that will give you opportunities to participate in workshops and interactive sessions to develop essential skills to navigate and enhance emotional well-being and interpersonal effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE\n",
      "\n",
      "Do I need to submit any evidence to get points for maintaining a minimum class attendance of 90% or above during one semester for all modules OR obtaining an Academic Merit Award?\n",
      "\n",
      "No. Your attendance records are always monitored and managed by the FRS system and the Student Information Office will send the list of students who meet the criteria to the PSG Administrator. Points will be updated automatically, so please check your PSG records frequently for updated points and contact PSG Administrator if you have any questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Similarly, The Student Academic Support (SAS) Department will collaborate with other academic departments to collect, verify, and send Academic Merit Award information to PSG Administrator. Once we receive the list from SAS, we will send confirmations to students who received the Academic Merit Award via email, then update the points automatically. If you receive an Academic Merit Award as per criteria set by the academic department, you will receive 20 points/semester at the maximum.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can contact PSG Administrator at psg@buv.edu.vn if you have any other questions about PSG Programme and its activities under the four quadrants and 16 categories, and we will answer your questions or direct you to the appropriate department for assistance.\n",
