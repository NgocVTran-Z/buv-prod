"This afternoon I got news that my 3PM class got cancelled but the email never mentioned that the Hai Bà Trưng bus that will pick me up at Aeon Mall at 1:55PM also got cancelled.

"Adding a 4:30 p.m. trip from BUV to reduce the two-hour waiting time between the current trips (3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.). This adjustment would improve convenience for students and staff with later schedules.
Considering starting the current Cau Giay trip at 7:30 a.m. or adding a separate 7:30 a.m. trip. The current trip consistently arrives significantly earlier than others (8 a.m. compared to 8:15 to 8:30 a.m.), ensuring better transportation for commuters.

"The bus schedule needs more flexible and fits the schedule of the students. In order to avoid making students wait too long for the bus. - In the afternoon, students can leave school at 2.30 pm or 4.30 pm 
","BUV bus is a shuttle bus service, and the schedule is arranged according to the certain number of students having class or scheduled activities on campus. It is provided on a first come first served basis and students should use the nearest bus slot for their class start/end time. Unfortunately, the bus service is not provided for individual schedules or small number of students but for the majority. Additionally, the buses must go round trips. Thus, we can’t have a bus for every hour because it's an hour just sufficient for the bus to make a one-way trip to Hanoi, and it takes another hour to come back to the campus. During your waiting time, you can utilise campus facilities for self-study or extracurricular activities around BUV Campus.

Why do you adjust the departure time of Ha Dong/Cau Giay route earlier (15 minutes earlier),"BUV bus is a shuttle bus service and buses are often assigned to more than one route in one day. Our school buses are on tight schedules.
