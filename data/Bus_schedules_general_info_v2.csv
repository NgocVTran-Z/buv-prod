"My name isXXX from XXX, so this afternoon I got news that my 3PM class got cancelled but the email never mentioned that the Hai Bà Trưng bus that will pick me up at Aeon Mall at 1:55PM also got cancelled. I arrived 20 mins early at the bus stop (yes, I mentioned that the class is cancelled but I want to go to BUV to take care of some stuff), waited for a bit and saw a Hai Bà Trưng bus with plenty of unoccupied seats passed by and thought 'there has got to be one more later on' but until 2:15PM there's still nothing.

"There must be more buses at various time slots. Sometimes I have to take very small and uncomfortable buses to school. The seats are hard, and the buses are always very crowded.

"Adding a 4:30 p.m. trip from BUV to reduce the two-hour waiting time between the current trips (3:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.). This adjustment would improve convenience for students and staff with later schedules.
Considering starting the current Cau Giay trip at 7:30 a.m. or adding a separate 7:30 a.m. trip. The current trip consistently arrives significantly earlier than others (8 a.m. compared to 8:15 to 8:30 a.m.), ensuring better transportation for commuters.

"Bus sometimes late and sometimes sooner than schedule, schedule is 8h25 but they come at 8h24 and go right away without waiting for 2 minutes as last semester","It is recommended that you arrive at the bus stop 5-10 minutes prior to the departure time to avoid missing the bus. The shuttle bus will arrive at the bus station and pick up passengers then move to the next pick-up and drop-off points to ensure the schedule for the whole route. However, in the process of traveling on the road, it is difficult for buses to avoid some traffic situations that affect the travel time of the vehicle.

"The bus schedule needs more flexible and fits the schedule of the students. In order to avoid making students wait too long for the bus. - In the afternoon, students can leave school at 2.30 pm or 4.30 pm 
","BUV bus is a shuttle bus service, and the schedule is arranged according to the certain number of students having class or scheduled activities on campus. It is provided on a first come first served basis and students should use the nearest bus slot for their class start/end time. Unfortunately, the bus service is not provided for individual schedules or small number of students but for the majority. Additionally, the buses must go round trips. Thus, we can’t have a bus for every hour because it's an hour just sufficient for the bus to make a one-way trip to Hanoi, and it takes another hour to come back to the campus. During your waiting time, you can utilise campus facilities for self-study or extracurricular activities around BUV Campus.

Provide more buses from 6:15 since at Wednesday we end the class at 6:00 but some can not went home by bus since their route was not available,"BUV bus is a shuttle bus service, and the schedule is arranged according to the certain number of students having class or scheduled activities on campus with minimum changes through the semester. It is provided on a first come first served basis and students should use the nearest bus slot for their class start/end time. Unfortunately, the bus service is not provided for individual schedules or a small number of students but for the majority. Besides, you can use Eco bus to travel from Hanoi to BUV and vice versa. If you use Ecobus services, please pass by the front desk at the main hall (level 1) to be guided and borrow the Ecobus card without any extra payment for this service."
My classes end at 1:45pm but we must wait for buses until 3:30 pm. That's nearly 2 hours of waiting. That is so time consuming. Can you adjust the schedule to suit the student's classes?,"BUV bus is a shuttle bus service, and the schedule is arranged according to the certain number of students having class or scheduled activities on campus.

Why do you adjust the departure time of Ha Dong/Cau Giay route earlier (15 minutes earlier),"BUV bus is a shuttle bus service and buses are often assigned to more than one route in one day. Our school buses are on tight schedules. If a bus is even a few minutes late, it puts everything out of schedule including the buses behind. “The 15 minutes” expectation also gives us a cushion in case we encounter unforeseen circumstances (accidents, broken traffic signals, traffic jams, inclement weather, etc.)"
What should I do if the bus does not arrive on time?,"School buses might run late due to unforeseen circumstances like traffic, accidents, road closures, prior run delays, etc. Students should arrive at the bus stop 5-10 minutes prior to the departure time to avoid missing the bus. Kindly contact transportation team at 0704 068 386 for prompt support. If students are late to school due to the delayed BUV bus arrival, they are not marked tardy."
What should I do in the event of “inclement weather”?,"Thank you for reaching out. In the event of “inclement weather,” drivers are instructed to follow certain procedures that could result in the bus being delayed. Students should arrive at the stop at least 05 minutes before the scheduled time and wait for at least 15 minutes after the scheduled time. Should you need any prompt support, please contact transportation team at 0704 068 386."
"If I have left an item on the bus, how do I get it returned?","Please go to the lost & found coutner at the reception on the 1st floor to fill in a report. Once the lost item is found, you will be contacted to come and collect your belonging if it matches your description."
When is the bus schedule for the weekday sent out?,The weekday bus schedules are usually sent out every Friday to all attending students of current semester and staff.
Do you have bus on weekend?,"The bus service is available limited on the weekend for pre-booked classes or event only. If you wish to use the bus on weekend, kindly contact transportation team at transportation@buv.edu.vn for further support."
